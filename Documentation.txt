PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

Title AI-Powered Code Reviewer and Quality Assistant

Project Statement Modern software development requires consistent and
efficient code reviews to maintain quality standards. Manual reviews are
time-consuming and highly dependent on reviewer expertise, often leading
to inconsistencies in feedback.

This project implements an AI-Powered Code Reviewer and Quality
Assistant that automatically analyzes Python source code for style
issues, maintainability concerns, performance risks, and potential
logical problems. The system combines static analysis using Python’s
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based
reasoning to generate actionable and context-aware feedback.

The tool supports both Command-Line Interface (CLI) usage and an
optional Streamlit-based Web UI for interactive review.

Key Features and Outcomes - CLI tool for automated Python code
analysis - AST-based extraction of functions, classes, and structure -
Detection of issues such as: • Missing docstrings • Missing type hints •
Poor naming conventions • Long or complex functions - Severity-based
categorization (Info, Warning, Critical) - AI-generated improvement
suggestions with explanations - Optional web dashboard for structured
visualization

System Modules

Code Parsing & Analysis - Parses Python files using AST - Extracts
structural components - Detects rule-based code smells

Rule Engine - Applies quality checks - Assigns severity levels - Ensures
standardized validation

AI Review Engine - Integrates with an LLM API - Provides contextual
suggestions and refactoring guidance

Reporting Module - Aggregates findings - Generates severity-based
summary reports

Interfaces - CLI for command-based execution - Streamlit UI for
interactive visualization

Workflow Source code input (CLI or UI) AST-based parsing Rule-based
static analysis Optional AI enhancement Categorized reporting and output

Conclusion The AI-Powered Code Reviewer and Quality Assistant
demonstrates a hybrid approach to automated code quality assurance by
combining deterministic static analysis with AI-driven reasoning. The
system enhances developer productivity, standardizes review quality, and
reduces manual review effort while maintaining structured and scalable
design principles.
